        "“Serverless”  is an architecture which uses an abstraction where the system designer or software developer doesn’t have to worry about the computing infrastructure underneath that is performing the work. As an example, Amazon’s **[A][WS Lambda]**, cloud-based product could be using Kubernetes or Docker containers to perform all the heavy lifting in terms of computational tasks. Serverless allows for a level of abstraction that forgoes the requirement of having to know the infrastructure on the underlying platform. A software developer instead can focus on writing the Python function that performs some task and is perhaps  attached to a “trigger”. \n",
        "(img)\n",
        "Other AWS server less technologies include **[AWS Athena]**,  an serverless interactive query service which can monitor an AWS S3 bucket and combine a number of data and do SQL queries on it.  In summary, Serverless allows you to simply focus on the business logic of the problem a developer or system designer is trying to solve.  Serverless is the highest level of abstraction, and sits above the “Platform as a Service” (PaaS).\n",
        "Examples of Serverless products available today:\n",
        "- [Google Cloud Functions]\n",
        "- [AWS Lambda]\n",

        "###Serverless Functions using AWS Lambda\n",
        "The whole foundational concept of Serverless computing is that of a “function”. AWS Lambda is an example of what could be termed “Function as a Service” (FaaS). Given Python’s prevalence in the ML community, one could argue that the core of anything that is built using the serverless paradigm is the Python function.\n",
